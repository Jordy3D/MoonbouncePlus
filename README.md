  <h1>Moonbounce Plus</h1>
  <p>A userscript that adds a few features to the Moonbounce website and experience.</p>
</div>

## Features

- Ponder for potential new crafting opportunities based on your inventory
- Appraise the value of your inventory, as well as how many items are contained within (both total and unique)
- Copy the info from the currently selected item to your clipboard (for data collection, such as for the [Moonbounce Wiki](https://moonbounce.wiki))
  - Click on the item's image to copy the item data

## Installation

1. Install a userscript manager for your browser. I recommend [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
2. Install the script by clicking [here](https://github.com/Jordy3D/MoonbouncePlus/raw/main/scripts/MoonbouncePlus.user.js).
3. The script should now be active on the Moonbounce website!

## Side Features

This repo also contains a Python script to help generate wiki page template code. It will output a .txt file for every item in the data file into a newly created `wiki` folder, organised by type.

## To-Do

- [ ] Add a feature to copy or save the image of the currently selected item
- [ ] Add sorting options to the inventory (by name, by type, by quantity, by rarity, by id, etc.)

## Changelog
