# Moonbounce Plus

A userscrript that adds a few features to the Moonbounce website and experience.

## Features

- Ponder for potential new crafting opportunities based on your inventory
- Copy the info from the currently selected item to your clipboard (for data collection, such as for the [Moonbounce Wiki](https://moonbounce.wiki))
  - Click on the item's image to copy the item data

## Installation

1. Install a userscript manager for your browser. I recommend [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
2. Install the script by clicking [here](https://github.com/Jordy3D/MoonbouncePlus/raw/main/scripts/MoonbouncePlus.user.js).
3. The script should now be active on the Moonbounce website!

## To-Do

- [ ] Add a feature to copy or save the image of the currently selected item
- [ ] Add sorting options to the inventory (by name, by type, by quantity, by rarity, by id, etc.)
- [ ] Add a feature to show the total amount of items in the inventory
